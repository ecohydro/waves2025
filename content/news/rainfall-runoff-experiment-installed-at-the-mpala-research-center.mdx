![Rain in Botswana](){: .align-left} Group members Trenton Franz, Alex Lester, and Lizzie King are off on a 3 week field campaign to install runoff experiment at Koija Group Ranch. 

<!--more--> The experiment consists of a suite of soil moisture TDR probes at various depths, runoff tanks with pressure transducers to record water level and a tipping bucket rain gage. Four patches: bare soil, perennial grass, A. tortilis, A. mellifera have been selected to measure the water balance flux terms of patch runoff and evapotranspiration. Some images from the trip are located here.
