The flux tower installed at the Mpala Research Center as part of Kelly’s CAREER award is now up and running. Over 4 weeks during January and February, Kelly and Lixin were working on instrumenting the tower to measure energy, carbon, and water fluxes as well as characterizing the isotopic composition of water vapor moving between the land surface and the atmosphere. The tower installation went well, thanks to the hard work of our construction crew from Digitel, who made a lot of extremely difficult logistics look easy. We’ve uploaded some pictures of the tower installation, which can be found here.
