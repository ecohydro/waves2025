![GRL 2012]()

We recently published a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/2014GL061439/" target="_blank">paper</a> in <a href="http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/agu/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1944-8007/" target="_blank"><em>Geophysical Research Letters</em></a> that investigates the relationship between the ratio of transpiration over evapotranspiration (T/ET) and leaf area index (LAI).<!--more--> We developed a function relating T/ET to the growing stage relative to the timing of peak LAI. LAI and growing stage collectively explained 43% of the variations in the global T/ET data set, providing a new way to interpret and model global T/ET variability.
