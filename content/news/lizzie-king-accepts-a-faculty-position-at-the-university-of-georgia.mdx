![Lizzie King](){: .align-right} Postdoctoral Research Associate Lizzie King has accepted an Assistant Professor position in Ecosystem Management at the University of Georgia in the Odum School of Ecology. The position is a joint appointment with the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources. Although we’re sad to see her leave Princeton, we’re thrilled that she’s found a position that fits her interests so well. We'll be saying our farewells to Lizzie early next year, but for now we’re happy to say:
