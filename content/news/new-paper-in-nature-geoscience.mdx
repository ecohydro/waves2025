[Kaiyu Guan](),[Kelly Caylor]() and [Adam Wolf]() recently published an <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2382.html" target="_blank">article</a> in <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/index.html" target="_blank">Nature Geoscience</a> and the article is currently on the front page of the journal's website.<!--more--> The article investigates the decline in forest productivity associated with drought. The authors conclude that water availability exerts a first-order control on vegetation seasonality in tropical forests globally and that their proposed framework can help identify where tropical forests may be vulnerable or resilient to future hydroclimatic changes.
