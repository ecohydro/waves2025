Kenya's National Science Week, organized by NACOSTI, aims to showcase achievements in science and technology in Kenya and provide a forum for scientists and stakeholders to interact. 

Two WAVES Lab members -  Charles Gitonga and Moses Kioko - were on hand to explain WAVES Lab research findings that have implications for smallholder agriculture, food security and rangeland management to visitors. Charles and Moses represented the Mpala Research Center in this weeklong event (May 22-26, 2017) for the second time this year. At the Mpala booth, they displayed informational materials (from Mpala's latest Mpala Memos newsletter and brochure to Rangeland Monitoring Guides and short documentaries) and featured poster presentations by students and researchers. 

Through the event, Charles and Moses connected with a wide variety of researchers and non-scientists, sparking interest in collaborations and increasing public awareness of our research, outreach and conservation efforts.
