![MMSF](){: .align-left} Two articles by our group on sap velocity measurements have been published in the March 2009 issue of Agricultural and Forest Meteorology. The articles describe a series of measurements and analyses that seek to derive a general framework for characterizing radial sap velocity profiles across species and individuals of varying sizes. The first paper describes the methodological development using data collected by Danilo Dragoni at Indiana University. The second paper extends the application to examine the effects of hillslope-scale heterogeneity on the responses of individual trees to soil moisture variation at daily time scales.
