The Caylor Lab and <a href="http://www.arable.com/" target="_blank">Arable</a> were recently featured in an article from the Princeton Alumni Weekly Magazine. <!--more-->As part of the cover story focused on the California drought, the article presents the work of three Princeton scientists studying water scarcity at different scales. Capable of monitoring rainfall, soil moisture and crop growth &#8211;among other variables&#8211; the Pulsepods developed by [Kelly Caylor](), [Adam Wolf](), and [Ben Siegfried]() will help farmers make better decisions about when and how much to fertilize and irrigate, optimizing water use to achieve higher yields.
