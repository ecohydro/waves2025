This summer, [Cynthia]()cynthia-gerlein-phd-student-2/" target="_blank">Cynthia Gerlein</a> and her intern Craig Sinkle spent the summer in the lab in Princeton to conduct an experiment looking at foliar water uptake.<!--more-->  After a few weeks spent growing _<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colocasia_esculenta" target="_blank">Colocasia esculenta</a>_, a tropical species, they subjected half of the plants to a drought treatment, while the other half received isotopically enriched water sprayed on the surface of the leaves every two days. The treatment experiment lasted 4 weeks during which they collected leaves from both treatments. They used the <a href="http://www.picarro.com/isotope_analyzers/im_crds" target="_blank">Picarro Induction Module</a> and spatial interpolation techniques to obtain high resolution maps of the spatial distribution of the isotopes within the leaves. This experiment, coupled with water potential experiments and a rigorous validation of the induction module data against IRMS data, will be the basis for Cynthia's effort to include foliar uptake into a leaf water balance model.
