An article examining the role of P availability on plant nutrition and above ground herbaceous productivity has been published in the Journal of Arid Environments

<!--more-->

An article authored by Lydia O’Halloran, Hank Shugart, Lixin Wang, Kelly, Susan Ringrose, and Barney Kgope has appeared in the Journal of Arid Environments. The paper describes the results of a nutrient addition experiment that was performed as part of Lydia’s dissertation research. The experiment tested nutrient controls on aboveground herbaceous primary productivity (ANPP) across a series of sites in the Kalahari region of Botswana. This particular paper focuses on P limitation across these sites. Surprisingly, while the results demonstrate higher levels of P in treatment plots, there were no detectable shifts in ANPP. While it’s impossible to tell for sure, I suspect that the hidden effects of higher P availability were morel likely due to shifts in seed biomass and/or belowground allocation.
