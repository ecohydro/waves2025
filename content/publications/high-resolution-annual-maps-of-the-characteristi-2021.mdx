  Understanding agricultural change requires reliable, frequently updated maps
  that describe the characteristics of croplands. Such data are often
  unavailable for regions dominated by smallholder agricultural systems, which
  are particularly challenging for remote sensing. To overcome these challenges,
  we designed a system to minimize several sources of error that arise when
  mapping smallholder croplands. To overcome errors caused by mismatches between
  image resolution and cropland scales, as well as persistent cloud cover, the
  system converts daily, 3.7 m PlanetScope imagery into two seasonal composites
  within a single agricultural year. To reduce errors that occur when training
  classifiers, we built a labelling platform that rigorously assesses label
  accuracy, and creates more accurate consensus labels that train a Random
  Forests model. The labelling platform and model interact within an active
  learning process that boosts the accuracy of the resulting cropland
  probability map, which is used in a segmentation process to delineate
  individual field boundaries. We applied this system to map Ghana’s croplands
  for the year 2018. We divided Ghana into 16 mapping regions (12,160-23,535
  km^2), training separate models for each using a total of 6,299 labels, plus
  1,600 for validation. Using an independent map reference sample (n=1,207), we
  found that overall accuracies of the resulting cropland probability and field
  boundary maps were 88% and 86.7%, respectively, with User’s accuracies for the
  cropland class of 61.2% and 78.9%, and Producer’s accuracies of 67.3% and
  58.2%. Croplands covered 16.1-23.2% of the mapped area, comprising 1,131,146
  total fields with an average size of 3.92 ha. Estimates based on the map
  reference sample indicate the cropland percentage is 17.1% (15.4-18.9%) or
  17.6% (15.6-19.6%), depending on the map used to estimate the standard error.
  Using the labellers’ digitized field boundaries to estimate biases in field
  boundary statistics, we calculated an adjusted mean field size of 1.73 ha and
  total field count of 1,662,281. Although the cropland class contained
  substantial errors, the system was effective in mitigating error and
  quantifying resulting performance gains. By minimizing training errors,
  consensus labelling improved the model’s F1 scores by up to 25%, while 3
  iterations of active learning increased the F1 score by 9.1%, on average,
  which was 2.3% higher than training models with randomly selected labels. Map
  accuracy can be improved by replacing Random Forests with a convolutional
  neural network. These results demonstrate a readily adapted, transferrable
  framework for developing high resolution, annual, nation-scale maps that
  provide important details about smallholder-dominated croplands.
