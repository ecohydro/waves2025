  Accurate and timely observations of individual‐scale transpiration are
  critical for predicting ecosystem responses to climate change. Existing remote
  sensing methods for measuring transpiration lack the spatial resolution needed
  to resolve individual plants, and their sources of uncertainty are not
  well‐constrained. We present two novel approaches for independently
  quantifying fine‐scale transpiration using thermal imagery and a suite of
  environmental sensors mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform.
  The first is a surface energy balance (SEB) approach designed for fine‐scale
  thermal imagery; the second uses profiles of air temperature (Ta) and humidity
  (hr) to calculate transpiration from the Bowen Ratio. Both approaches derive
  the energy equivalent of transpiration, latent heat flux (λE), solely using
  data acquired from the UAV. We compare the two approaches and their sources of
  uncertainty using data from several flights at a grassland eddy covariance
  site in 2021 and 2022 and using typical diurnal conditions to evaluate the
  uncertainty of λE estimates for each approach. The SEB approach generated
  independent, UAV‐based estimates of λE within ∼20% of eddy covariance
  measurements and was most sensitive to surface temperature and resistance to
  heat transfer. λE calculated from the Bowen Ratio approach was ∼30% higher
  than tower values due to inaccuracies in Ta and hr, the main sources of
  uncertainty in this approach. The Bowen Ratio approach has a lower overall
  potential uncertainty, indicating its potential for improvement over the SEB
  approach. Our results are the first physically‐based observations of
  transpiration derived solely from a UAV platform, with no ancillary data
  inputs.
