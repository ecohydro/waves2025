    [1] Soil moisture is the environmental variable synthesizing the effect of
    climate, soil, and vegetation on the dynamics of water-limited ecosystems.
    Unlike abiotic factors (e.g., soil texture and rainfall regime), the control
    exerted by vegetation composition and structure on soil moisture variability
    remains poorly understood. A number of field studies in dryland landscapes
    have found higher soil water contents in vegetated soil patches than in
    adjacent bare soil, providing a convincing explanation for the observed
    preferential establishment of grasses and seedlings beneath tree canopies.
    Thus, because water is the limiting factor for vegetation in arid and
    semiarid ecosystems, a positive feedback could exist between soil moisture
    and woody vegetation dynamics. It is still unclear how the strength of such
    a feedback would change under different long-term rainfall regimes. To this
    end, we report some field observations from savanna ecosystems located along
    the south-north rainfall gradient in the Kalahari, where the presence of
    relatively uniform sandy soils limits the effects of covarying factors. The
    data available from our field study suggest that the contrast between the
    soil moisture in the canopy and intercanopy space increases (with wetter
    soils under the canopy) with increasing levels of aridity. We hypothesize
    that this contrast may lead to a positive feedback and explore the
    implications of such a feedback in a minimalistic model. We found that when
    the feedback is relatively strong, the system may exhibit two stable states
    corresponding to conditions with and without tree canopy cover. In this
    case, even small changes in environmental variables may lead to rapid and
    largely irreversible shifts to a state with no tree canopy cover. Our data
    suggest that the tendency of the system to exhibit two (alternative) stable
    states becomes stronger in the more arid regions. Thus, at the desert
    margins, vegetation is more likely to be prone to discontinuous and abrupt
    state changes.

Soil moisture is the environmental variable synthesizing the effect of climate, soil, and vegetation on the dynamics of water-limited ecosystems. Unlike abiotic factors (e.g., soil texture and rainfall regime), the control exerted by vegetation composition and structure on soil moisture variability remains poorly understood. A number of field studies in dryland landscapes have found higher soil water contents in vegetated soil patches than in adjacent bare soil, providing a convincing explanation for the observed preferential establishment of grasses and seedlings beneath tree canopies. Thus, because water is the limiting factor for vegetation in arid and semiarid ecosystems, a positive feedback could exist between soil moisture and woody vegetation dynamics. It is still unclear how the strength of such a feedback would change under different long-term rainfall regimes. To this end, we report some field observations from savanna ecosystems located along the south-north rainfall gradient in the Kalahari, where the presence of relatively uniform sandy soils limits the effects of covarying factors. 

The data available from our field study suggest that the contrast between the soil moisture in the canopy and intercanopy space increases (with wetter soils under the canopy) with increasing levels of aridity. We hypothesize that this contrast may lead to a positive feedback and explore the implications of such a feedback in a minimalistic model.
