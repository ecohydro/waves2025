  abstract: >-
    The impact of human activity on the biophysical world raises myriad
    challenges for sustaining Earth system processes, ecosystem services, and
    human societies. To engage in meaningful problem-solving in the hydrosphere,
    this necessitates an approach that recognizes the coupled nature of human
    and biophysical systems. We argue that, in order to produce the next
    generation of problem-solvers, hydrology education should ensure that
    students develop an appreciation and working familiarity in the context of
    coupled human-environmental systems. We illustrate how undergraduate-level
    hydrology assignments can extend beyond rote computations or basic
    throughput scenarios to include consideration of the dynamic interactions
    with social and other biophysical dimensions of complex adaptive systems.
    Such an educational approach not only builds appropriate breadth of dynamic
    understanding, but can also empower students toward assuming influential and
    effective roles in solving sustainability challenges.
