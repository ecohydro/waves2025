    Agricultural supply chains play a crucial role in supporting food security
    in Africa. However, high-resolution supply chain information is often not
    available, which hinders our ability to determine which interventions in
    food supply chains would most enhance food security. In this study, we
    develop a high-resolution supply chain model for essential staple crops in
    Zambia, aiming to estimate how improvements in transportation infrastructure
    would impact food security. Specifically, we simulate district-level monthly
    consumption, trade flows, and storage for maize and cassava in Zambia. We
    then conduct a counterfactual case study with low transportation costs,
    discovering that reducing transaction costs leads to higher aggregate net
    agricultural revenue and aggregate net expenditure. These results indicate
    that transportation investments are more beneficial to suppliers than to
    consumers, with implications for household food security in smallholder
    agriculture. Our study highlights the potential for infrastructure
    investments to improve food security.

**Abstract**: 
 Agricultural supply chains play a crucial role in supporting food security in Africa. However, high-resolution supply chain information is often not available, which hinders our ability to determine which interventions in food supply chains would most enhance food security. In this study, we develop a high-resolution supply chain model for essential staple crops in Zambia, aiming to estimate how improvements in transportation infrastructure would impact food security. Specifically, we simulate district-level monthly consumption, trade flows, and storage for maize and cassava in Zambia. We then conduct a counterfactual case study with low transportation costs, discovering that reducing transaction costs leads to higher aggregate net agricultural revenue and aggregate net expenditure. These results indicate that transportation investments are more beneficial to suppliers than to consumers, with implications for household food security in smallholder agriculture. Our study highlights the potential for infrastructure investments to improve food security.
