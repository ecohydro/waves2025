    In dryland ecosystems, vegetation within different plant functional groups
    exhibits distinct seasonal phenologies that are affected by the prevailing
    hydroclimatic forcing. The seasonal variability of precipitation,
    atmospheric evaporative demand, and streamflow influences root-zone water
    availability to plants in water-limited environments. Increasing interannual
    variations in climate forcing of the local water balance and uncertainty
    regarding climate change projections have raised the potential for
    phenological shifts and changes to vegetation dynamics. This poses
    significant risks to plant functional types across large areas, especially
    in drylands and within riparian ecosystems. Due to the complex interactions
    between climate, water availability, and seasonal plant water use, the
    timing and amplitude of phenological responses to specific hydroclimate
    forcing cannot be determined a priori, thus limiting efforts to dynamically
    predict vegetation greenness under future climate change. Here, we analyze
    two decades (1994–2021) of remote sensing data (soil adjusted vegetation
    index (SAVI)) as well as contemporaneous hydroclimate data (precipitation,
    potential evapotranspiration, depth to groundwater, and air temperature), to
    identify and quantify the key hydroclimatic controls on the timing and
    amplitude of seasonal greenness. We focus on key phenological events across
    four different plant functional groups occupying distinct locations and
    rooting depths in dryland SE Arizona: semi-arid grasses and shrubs, xeric
    riparian terrace and hydric riparian floodplain trees. We find that key
    phenological events such as spring and summer greenness peaks in grass and
    shrubs are strongly driven by contributions from antecedent spring and
    monsoonal precipitation, respectively. Meanwhile seasonal canopy greenness
    in floodplain and terrace vegetation showed strong response to groundwater
    depth as well as antecedent available precipitation (aaP = P − PET)
    throughout reaches of perennial and intermediate streamflow permanence. The
    timings of spring green-up and autumn senescence were driven by seasonal
    changes in air temperature for all plant functional groups. Based on these
    findings, we develop and test a simple, empirical phenology model, that
    predicts the timing and amplitude of greenness based on hydroclimate
    forcing. We demonstrate the feasibility of the model by exploring simple,
    plausible climate change scenarios, which may inform our understanding of
    phenological shifts in dryland plant communities and may ultimately improve
    our predictive capability of investigating and predicting climate-phenology
    interactions in the future.

**Abstract**: In dryland ecosystems, vegetation within different plant functional groups exhibits distinct seasonal phenologies that are affected by the prevailing hydroclimatic forcing. The seasonal variability of precipitation, atmospheric evaporative demand, and streamflow influences root-zone water availability to plants in water-limited environments. Increasing interannual variations in climate forcing of the local water balance and uncertainty regarding climate change projections have raised the potential for phenological shifts and changes to vegetation dynamics. This poses significant risks to plant functional types across large areas, especially in drylands and within riparian ecosystems. Due to the complex interactions between climate, water availability, and seasonal plant water use, the timing and amplitude of phenological responses to specific hydroclimate forcing cannot be determined a priori, thus limiting efforts to dynamically predict vegetation greenness under future climate change. Here, we analyze two decades (1994–2021) of remote sensing data (soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)) as well as contemporaneous hydroclimate data (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, depth to groundwater, and air temperature), to identify and quantify the key hydroclimatic controls on the timing and amplitude of seasonal greenness. We focus on key phenological events across four different plant functional groups occupying distinct locations and rooting depths in dryland SE Arizona: semi-arid grasses and shrubs, xeric riparian terrace and hydric riparian floodplain trees. We find that key phenological events such as spring and summer greenness peaks in grass and shrubs are strongly driven by contributions from antecedent spring and monsoonal precipitation, respectively. Meanwhile seasonal canopy greenness in floodplain and terrace vegetation showed strong response to groundwater depth as well as antecedent available precipitation (aaP = P − PET) throughout reaches of perennial and intermediate streamflow permanence. The timings of spring green-up and autumn senescence were driven by seasonal changes in air temperature for all plant functional groups. Based on these findings, we develop and test a simple, empirical phenology model, that predicts the timing and amplitude of greenness based on hydroclimate forcing. We demonstrate the feasibility of the model by exploring simple, plausible climate change scenarios, which may inform our understanding of phenological shifts in dryland plant communities and may ultimately improve our predictive capability of investigating and predicting climate-phenology interactions in the future.
