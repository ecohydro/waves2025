  Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions of the world are dominated by
  smallholder farms, which are characterized by small, heterogeneous, and often
  indistinct field patterns. In previous work, we developed an algorithm for
  mapping both smallholder and commercial agricultural fields that includes
  efficient extraction of a vast set of simple, highly correlated, and
  interdependent features, followed by a random forest classifier. In this
  paper, we demonstrated how active learning can be incorporated in the
  algorithm to create smaller, more efficient training data sets, which reduced
  computational resources, minimized the need for humans to hand-label data, and
  boosted performance. We designed a patch-based uncertainty metric to drive the
  active learning framework, based on the regular grid of a crowdsourcing
  platform, and demonstrated how subject matter experts can be replaced with
  fleets of crowdsourcing workers. Our active learning algorithm achieved
  similar performance as an algorithm trained with randomly selected data, but
  with 62% less data samples.
