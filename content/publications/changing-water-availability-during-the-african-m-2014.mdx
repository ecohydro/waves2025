  Understanding how global change is impacting African agriculture requires a
  full physical accounting of water supply and demand, but accurate, gridded
  data on key drivers (e.g., humidity) are generally unavailable. We used a new
  bias-corrected meteorological dataset to analyze changes in precipitation
  (supply), potential evapotranspiration ( E p ?> , demand), and water
  availability (expressed as the ratio P / E p ?> ) in 20 countries (focusing on
  their maize-growing regions and seasons), between 1979 and 2010, and the
  factors driving changes in E p ?> . Maize-growing areas in Southern Africa,
  particularly South Africa, benefitted from increased water availability due in
  large part to demand declines driven primarily by declining net radiation,
  increasing vapor pressure, and falling temperatures (with no effect from
  changing windspeed), with smaller increases in supply. Sahelian zone countries
  in West Africa, as well as Ethiopia in East Africa, had strong increases in
  availability driven primarily by rainfall rebounding from the long-term
  Sahelian droughts, with little change or small reductions in demand. However,
  intra-seasonal supply variability generally increased in West and East Africa.
  Across all three regions, declining net radiation contributed downwards
  pressure on demand, generally over-riding upwards pressure caused by
  increasing temperatures, the regional effects of which were largest in East
  Africa. A small number of countries, mostly in or near East Africa (Tanzania
  and Malawi) experienced declines in water availability primarily due to
  decreased rainfall, but exacerbated by increasing demand. Much of the reduced
  water availability in East Africa occurred during the more sensitive middle
  part of the maize-growing season, suggesting negative consequences for maize
  production.
