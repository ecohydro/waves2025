  Groundwater is critical for many ecosystems, yet groundwater requirements for
  dependent ecosystems are rarely accounted for during water and conservation
  planning. Here we compile 38 years of Landsat-derived normalized difference
  vegetation index (NDVI) to evaluate groundwater-dependent vegetation responses
  to changes in depth to groundwater (DTG) across California. To maximize
  applicability, we standardized raw NDVI and DTG values using Z scores to
  identify groundwater thresholds, groundwater targets and map potential drought
  refugia across a diversity of biomes and local conditions. Groundwater
  thresholds were analysed for vegetation impacts where ZNDVI dropped below −1.
  ZDTG thresholds and targets were then evaluated with respect to
  groundwater-dependent vegetation in different condition classes and rooting
  depths. ZNDVI scores were applied statewide to identify potential drought
  refugia supported by groundwater. Our approach provides a simple and robust
  methodology for water and conservation practitioners to support ecosystem
  water needs so biodiversity and sustainable water-management goals can be
  achieved.
