    To understand ecological phenomena, it is necessary to observe their
    behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since this need was
    first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously
    inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have
    been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we
    analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations
    (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004
    and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because
    ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial
    domain, most observations had resolutions ≤1 m2 and extents ≤10,000 ha. In
    the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or
    infrequently repeated (>1 month interval) and ≤1 year in duration. Compared
    with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions
    appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents
    larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are
    actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent,
    raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most
    studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor
    concern. Ecologists can better understand the scales represented by
    observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can
    promote attentiveness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards.
    Analysing the spatial and temporal extents of 348 ecological studies
    published between 2004 and 2014, the authors show that although the average
    study interval and extent has increased, resolution and duration have
    remained largely unchanged.

    It is shown that although the average study interval and extent has
    increased, resolution and duration have remained largely unchanged, and a

    the scales those observations ostensibly represent is found, raising
    concerns about observational comprehensiveness.

**Abstract**:To understand ecological phenomena, it is necessary to observe their behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since this need was first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004 and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial domain, most observations had resolutions ≤1 m2 and extents ≤10,000 ha. In the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or infrequently repeated (>1 month interval) and ≤1 year in duration. Compared with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent, raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor concern. Ecologists can better understand the scales represented by observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can promote attentiveness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards.
