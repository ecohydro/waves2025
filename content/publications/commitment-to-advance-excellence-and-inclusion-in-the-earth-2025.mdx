abstract: >
  Addressing global challenges and advancing knowledge in the Earth and space sciences requires an equitable, diverse, and inclusive scholarly community where researchers must be freely able to conduct, collaborate on, share, review, and discuss their research on important economic and societal topics such as climate change. The current Executive Orders in the United States focus on censoring research and researchers by banning specific words, removing access to data sets, or by restricting what type of research can be funded or published, therefore compromising the knowledge that researchers are able to produce. As Editors‐in‐Chief of AGU publications we stand by our mission to support the publication of evidence‐based, rigorously vetted research without political pressure. Collectively, our peer‐reviewed journals and books provide inclusive publication outlets for the global research community to advance Earth and space sciences and to strengthen the public's trust in scientific evidence.
