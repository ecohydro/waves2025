    The complex interactions between plants, soils, and climates in semiarid
    ecosystems make it difficult to define specific ecohydrological optimization
    mechanisms that underlie observed spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation
    structure. There remains a clear need to develop conceptual models that are
    capable of interpreting and predicting spatial pattern formation in savannas
    (and similar dry woodland ecosystems), as well as metrics for assessing
    optimization or organization of patterns, as one scales from individual
    canopies to landscapes and beyond. In this article, we propose a unifying
    hypothesis regarding ecohydrological optimization of pattern and processes,
    namely, that vegetation patterns in water‐limited environments are
    constrained in their ability to maximize water use by a need to
    simultaneously minimize water stress. We use this trade‐off‐based hypothesis
    to infer the function of dryland ecosystems under a wide range of scales and
    applications. Specifically, we examine spatial and temporal aspects of
    ecohydrological organization of vegetation patterns for three different
    cases: (1) patterns of regional‐scale temporal organization across a
    regional climate gradient, (2) patterns of landscape‐scale spatial
    organization within a semiarid drainage basin, and (3) patterns of
    individual‐scale structural organization across varying soil textures.
    Although the insight gained from each of these examples is derived from
    specific modeling approaches, each of which contains its own unique set of
    assumptions and limitations, they are unified by our proposed
    ecohydrological trade‐off approach that simultaneously considers both plant
    water deficit and plant water use as a diagnostic tool for assessing
    vegetation patterns in water‐limited environments. It is our hope that the
    ongoing development of coupled ecological and hydrological models capable of
    assessing a diversity of interactions between plants, soils, and climates
    will lead to the emergence of more generalized hypotheses regarding the
    manner by which ecological and hydrological patterns coorganize in
    landscapes.

The complex interactions between plants, soils, and climates in semiarid ecosystems make it difficult to define specific ecohydrological optimization mechanisms that underlie observed spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation structure. There remains a clear need to develop conceptual models that are capable of interpreting and predicting spatial pattern formation in savannas (and similar dry woodland ecosystems), as well as metrics for assessing optimization or organization of patterns, as one scales from individual canopies to landscapes and beyond. 

In this article, we propose a unifying hypothesis regarding ecohydrological optimization of pattern and processes, namely, that vegetation patterns in water-limited environments are constrained in their ability to maximize water use by a need to simultaneously minimize water stress. We use this trade-off-based hypothesis to infer the function of dryland ecosystems under a wide range of scales and applications. Specifically, we examine spatial and temporal aspects of ecohydrological organization of vegetation patterns for three different cases: (1) patterns of regional-scale temporal organization across a regional climate gradient, (2) patterns of landscape-scale spatial organization within a semiarid drainage basin, and (3) patterns of individual-scale structural organization across varying soil textures.
