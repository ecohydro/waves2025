abstract: >-
  Kenyan river basin governance underwent a pioneering reform in the Water Act
  of 2002, which established new community water-management institutions. This
  article focuses on community water projects in the Likii Water Resource Users
  Association in the Upper Ewaso Ng’iro River basin on Mount Kenya, and the
  extent to which their features are consistent with Ostrom’s design principles
  of natural resource management. Although the projects have developed solid
  institutional structures, pressures such as hydroclimatic change, population
  growth, and water inequality challenge their ability to manage their water
  resources. Institutional homogeneity across the different water projects and
  congruence with the design principles is not necessarily a positive factor.
  Strong differences in household water flows within and among the projects
  point to the disconnection between apparently successful institutions and
  their objectives, such as fair and equitable water allocation.
