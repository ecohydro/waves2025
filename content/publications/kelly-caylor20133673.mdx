    Society is facing growing environmental problems that require new research
    efforts to understand the way ecosystems operate and survive, and their
    mutual relationships with the hydrologic cycle. In this respect,
    ecohydrology suggests a renewed interdisciplinary approach that aims to
    provide a better comprehension of the effects of climatic changes on
    terrestrial ecosystems. With this aim, a coupled hydrological/ecological
    model is adopted to describe simultaneously vegetation pattern evolution and
    hydrological water budget at the basin scale using as test site the Upper
    Rio Salado basin (Sevilleta, NM, USA). The hydrological analyses have been
    carried out using a recently formulated framework for the water balance at
    the daily level linked with a spatial model for the description of the
    spatial organization of vegetation. This enables quantitatively assessing
    the effects on soil water availability on future climatic scenarios. Results
    highlighted that the relationship between climatic forcing (water
    availability) and vegetation patterns is strongly non-linear. This implies,
    under some specific conditions which depend on the ecosystem
    characteristics, small changes in climatic conditions may produce
    significant transformation of the vegetation patterns.

With this aim, a coupled hydrological/ecological model is adopted to describe simultaneously vegetation pattern evolution and hydrological water budget at the basin scale using as test site the Upper Rio Salado basin (Sevilleta, NM, USA). The hydrological analyses have been carried out using a recently formulated framework for the water balance at the daily level linked with a spatial model for the description of the spatial organization of vegetation.
