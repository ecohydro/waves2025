    Remote sensing, or Earth Observation (EO), is increasingly used to
    understand Earth system dynamics and create continuous and categorical maps
    of biophysical properties and land cover, especially based on recent
    advances in machine learning (ML). ML models typically require large,
    spatially explicit training datasets to make accurate predictions. Training
    data (TD) are typically generated by digitizing polygons on high
    spatial-resolution imagery, by collecting in situ data, or by using
    pre-existing datasets. TD are often assumed to accurately represent the
    truth, but in practice almost always have error, stemming from (1) sample
    design, and (2) sample collection errors. The latter is particularly
    relevant for image-interpreted TD, an increasingly commonly used method due
    to its practicality and the increasing training sample size requirements of
    modern ML algorithms. TD errors can cause substantial errors in the maps
    created using ML algorithms, which may impact map use and interpretation.
    Despite these potential errors and their real-world consequences for
    map-based decisions, TD error is often not accounted for or reported in EO
    research. Here we review the current practices for collecting and handling
    TD. We identify the sources of TD error, and illustrate their impacts using
    several case studies representing different EO applications (infrastructure
    mapping, global surface flux estimates, and agricultural monitoring), and
    provide guidelines for minimizing and accounting for TD errors. To harmonize
    terminology, we distinguish TD from three other classes of data that should
    be used to create and assess ML models: training reference data, used to
    assess the quality of TD during data generation; validation data, used to
    iteratively improve models; and map reference data, used only for final
    accuracy assessment. We focus primarily on TD, but our advice is generally
    applicable to all four classes, and we ground our review in established best
    practices for map accuracy assessment literature. EO researchers should
    start by determining the tolerable levels of map error and appropriate error
    metrics. Next, TD error should be minimized during sample design by choosing
    a representative spatio-temporal collection strategy, by using spatially and
    temporally relevant imagery and ancillary data sources during TD creation,
    and by selecting a set of legend definitions supported by the data.
    Furthermore, TD error can be minimized during the collection of individual
    samples by using consensus-based collection strategies, by directly
    comparing interpreted training observations against expert-generated
    training reference data to derive TD error metrics, and by providing image
    interpreters with thorough application-specific training. We strongly advise
    that TD error is incorporated in model outputs, either directly in bias and
    variance estimates or, at a minimum, by documenting the sources and
    implications of error. TD should be fully documented and made available via
    an open TD repository, allowing others to replicate and assess its use. To
    guide researchers in this process, we propose three tiers of TD error
    accounting standards. Finally, we advise researchers to clearly communicate
    the magnitude and impacts of TD error on map outputs, with specific
    consideration given to the likely map audience.

**Abstract**:Remote sensing, or Earth Observation (EO), is increasingly used to understand Earth system dynamics and create continuous and categorical maps of biophysical properties and land cover, especially based on recent advances in machine learning (ML). ML models typically require large, spatially explicit training datasets to make accurate predictions. Training data (TD) are typically generated by digitizing polygons on high spatial-resolution imagery, by collecting in situ data, or by using pre-existing datasets. TD are often assumed to accurately represent the truth, but in practice almost always have error, stemming from (1) sample design, and (2) sample collection errors. The latter is particularly relevant for image-interpreted TD, an increasingly commonly used method due to its practicality and the increasing training sample size requirements of modern ML algorithms. TD errors can cause substantial errors in the maps created using ML algorithms, which may impact map use and interpretation. Despite these potential errors and their real-world consequences for map-based decisions, TD error is often not accounted for or reported in EO research. Here we review the current practices for collecting and handling TD. We identify the sources of TD error, and illustrate their impacts using several case studies representing different EO applications (infrastructure mapping, global surface flux estimates, and agricultural monitoring), and provide guidelines for minimizing and accounting for TD errors. To harmonize terminology, we distinguish TD from three other classes of data that should be used to create and assess ML models: training reference data, used to assess the quality of TD during data generation; validation data, used to iteratively improve models; and map reference data, used only for final accuracy assessment. We focus primarily on TD, but our advice is generally applicable to all four classes, and we ground our review in established best practices for map accuracy assessment literature. EO researchers should start by determining the tolerable levels of map error and appropriate error metrics. Next, TD error should be minimized during sample design by choosing a representative spatio-temporal collection strategy, by using spatially and temporally relevant imagery and ancillary data sources during TD creation, and by selecting a set of legend definitions supported by the data. Furthermore, TD error can be minimized during the collection of individual samples by using consensus-based collection strategies, by directly comparing interpreted training observations against expert-generated training reference data to derive TD error metrics, and by providing image interpreters with thorough application-specific training. We strongly advise that TD error is incorporated in model outputs, either directly in bias and variance estimates or, at a minimum, by documenting the sources and implications of error. TD should be fully documented and made available via an open TD repository, allowing others to replicate and assess its use. To guide researchers in this process, we propose three tiers of TD error accounting standards. Finally, we advise researchers to clearly communicate the magnitude and impacts of TD error on map outputs, with specific consideration given to the likely map audience.
