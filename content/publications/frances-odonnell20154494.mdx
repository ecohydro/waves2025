    The relative importance of resource competition and disturbance in limiting
    woody cover is one of the most basic questions in savanna ecology. Modeling
    approaches that seek to address this question are limited in their ability
    to accurately represent resource competition, which occurs belowground, by
    the limited detail of existing data on root system structure. Using
    compressed air, we excavated individual trees and shrubs and mapped their
    coarse roots on a three-dimensional grid system up to 1.5 m depth. We
    excavated four woody savanna species at three sites spanning a climate
    gradient on the Kalahari Transect in southern Africa and determined
    functions to describe the distribution of root biomass within the root
    systems. Overall, most of the variation in both large-scale and small-scale
    characteristics of root system structure was related to species. The species
    excavated fell into two groups that coexisted across the climate gradient.
    Acacia mellifera and Terminalia sericea had straight roots in a laterally
    extensive system that was shallow relative to the aggregate root profile for
    woody plants at the sites. Boscia albitrunca and Ochna pulchra had sinuous
    roots that were mostly concentrated beneath the canopy and were more
    prevalent in deep than near-surface soil layers, departing from the
    conventional model of decreasing root abundance with depth. Based on our
    results, we suggest a reframing of the theoretical characterization of the
    root zone used in modeling approaches to consider diversity within the woody
    plant community.

The relative importance of resource competition and disturbance in limiting woody cover is one of the most basic questions in savanna ecology. Modeling approaches that seek to address this question are limited in their ability to accurately represent resource competition, which occurs belowground, by the limited detail of existing data on root system structure. Using compressed air, we excavated individual trees and shrubs and mapped their coarse roots on a three-dimensional grid system up to 1.5 m depth. We excavated four woody savanna species at three sites spanning a climate gradient on the Kalahari Transect in southern Africa and determined functions to describe the distribution of root biomass within the root systems. Overall, most of the variation in both large-scale and small-scale characteristics of root system structure was related to species. The species excavated fell into two groups that coexisted across the climate gradient.

had straight roots in a laterally extensive system that was shallow relative to the aggregate root profile for woody plants at the sites.

had sinuous roots that were mostly concentrated beneath the canopy and were more prevalent in deep than near-surface soil layers, departing from the conventional model of decreasing root abundance with depth.
