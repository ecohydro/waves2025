  Abstract. Rainfall gauge networks in Sub-Saharan Africa are inadequate for
  assessing Sahelian agricultural drought, hence satellite-based estimates of
  precipitation and vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference
  Vegetation Index (NDVI) provide the main source of information for early
  warning systems. While it is common practice to translate precipitation into
  estimates of soil moisture, it is difficult to quantitatively compare
  precipitation and soil moisture estimates with variations in NDVI. In the
  context of agricultural drought early warning, this study quantitatively
  compares rainfall, soil moisture and NDVI using a simple statistical model to
  translate NDVI values into estimates of soil moisture. The model was
  calibrated using in-situ soil moisture observations from southwest Niger, and
  then used to estimate root zone soil moisture across the African Sahel from
  2001–2012. We then used these NDVI-soil moisture estimates (NSM) to quantify
  agricultural drought, and compared our results with a precipitation-based
  estimate of soil moisture (the Antecedent Precipitation Index, API),
  calibrated to the same in-situ soil moisture observations. We also used
  in-situ soil moisture observations in Mali and Kenya to assess performance in
  other water-limited locations in sub Saharan Africa. The separate estimates of
  soil moisture were highly correlated across the semi-arid, West and Central
  African Sahel, where annual rainfall exhibits a uni-modal regime. We also
  found that seasonal API and NDVI-soil moisture showed high rank correlation
  with a crop water balance model, capturing known agricultural drought years in
  Niger, indicating that this new estimate of soil moisture can contribute to
  operational drought monitoring. In-situ soil moisture observations from Kenya
  highlighted how the rainfall-driven API needs to be recalibrated in locations
  with multiple rainy seasons (e.g., Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia). Our soil
  moisture estimates from NDVI, on the other hand, performed well in Niger, Mali
  and Kenya. This suggests that the NDVI-soil moisture relationship may be more
  robust across rainfall regimes than the API because the relationship between
  NDVI and plant available water is less reliant on local characteristics (e.g.,
  infiltration, runoff, evaporation) than the relationship between rainfall and
  soil moisture.
