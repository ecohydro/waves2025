    ABSTRACT Information and services delivered through mobile phones,
    ‘m-services', have transformative potential to provide rural African farmers
    with important agro-meteorological information. However, a greater
    understanding is needed regarding the types of m-services available to
    farmers, how farmers access that information, and possible factors affecting
    m-service use. With a study of smallholder farming communities in central
    Kenya, we examine factors affecting the likelihood of Kenyan farmers’
    adoption of m-services specifically related to agriculture and livestock
    information, buying and selling products, and alerts about agricultural or
    livestock activities. According to a survey of 577 farming households, 98%
    of respondents own a mobile phone. Approximately 25% use it to access
    information about agriculture and livestock, 23% access information about
    buying and selling products, and 18% receive alerts. Personal smartphone
    ownership increases the likelihood of m-services use (p < .001), as does
    membership in farmer organizations (p < .001). We find that age and income
    are not significantly related to m-service use, and we discuss this result
    in terms of intersections between smartphone ownership, gender, and
    education. Consistent with prior qualitative research, our quantitative
    results further support the need for m-services providers to design for
    basic or feature phone users for improved dissemination of
    agro-meteorological information.

**Abstract**:Information and services delivered through mobile phones, ‘m-services', have transformative potential to provide rural African farmers with important agro-meteorological information. However, a greater understanding is needed regarding the types of m-services available to farmers, how farmers access that information, and possible factors affecting m-service use. With a study of smallholder farming communities in central Kenya, we examine factors affecting the likelihood of Kenyan farmers’ adoption of m-services specifically related to agriculture and livestock information, buying and selling products, and alerts about agricultural or livestock activities. According to a survey of 577 farming households, 98% of respondents own a mobile phone. Approximately 25% use it to access information about agriculture and livestock, 23% access information about buying and selling products, and 18% receive alerts. Personal smartphone ownership increases the likelihood of m-services use (p < .001), as does membership in farmer organizations (p < .001). We find that age and income are not significantly related to m-service use, and we discuss this result in terms of intersections between smartphone ownership, gender, and education. Consistent with prior qualitative research, our quantitative results further support the need for m-services providers to design for basic or feature phone users for improved dissemination of agro-meteorological information.
