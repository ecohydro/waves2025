  Ecohydrological models provide a tool to investigate the mutual relationships
  between vegetation and the hydrological cycle. Ecohydrological modelling
  studies in developing countries, such as sub-saharan Africa often face the
  problem of extensive parametrical requirements and limited available data.
  Satellite remote sensing data may be able to fill 15 this gap, but require
  novel methodologies to exploit its spatio-temporal information that could
  potentially be incorporated in ecohydrological model calibration and
  validation. The present study aims to implement a distributed ecohydrological
  daily model in a data scarce environment with the support of remote sensing
  data. An automatic calibration procedure, based on Empirical Orthogonal
  Functions techniques, is proposed and applied in the Upper Ewaso river basin
  in Kenya. The model is calibrated only using NDVI (Normalized Difference 20
  Vegetation Index) data derived from MODIS. The obtained results demonstrate
  that: (1) satellite data of vegetation dynamics contains an extraordinary
  amount of information that can be used to implement ecohydrological models in
  scarce data dry regions; (2) the model calibrated only using satellite data is
  able to reproduce both the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics and the
  observed discharge at the outlet point; and (3) the proposed semi-automatic
  calibration methodology works satisfactorily and it allows to incorporate
  spatio-temporal data in the model parametrization. 25
