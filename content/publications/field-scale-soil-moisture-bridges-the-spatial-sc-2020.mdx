  Abstract. Soil moisture is highly variable in space and time, and deficits
  (i.e.,

  droughts) play an important role in modulating crop yields. Limited

  hydroclimate and yield data, however, hamper drought impact monitoring and

  assessment at the farm field scale. This study demonstrates the potential of
  using field-scale soil moisture simulations to support high-resolution
  agricultural yield prediction and drought monitoring at the smallholder farm
  field scale. We present a multiscale modeling approach that combines
  HydroBlocks – a physically based hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM) –
  with machine learning. We used HydroBlocks to simulate root zone soil moisture
  and soil temperature in Zambia at 3 h 30 m resolution. These simulations,
  along with remotely sensed vegetation indices, meteorological data, and
  descriptors of the physical landscape (related to topography, land cover, and
  soils) were combined with district-level maize data to train a random forest
  (RF) model to predict maize yields at district and field scales (250 m). Our
  model predicted yields with an average testing coefficient of determination
  (R2) of 0.57 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 310 kg ha−1 using year-based
  cross-validation. Our predicted maize losses due to the 2015–2016 El Niño
  drought agreed well with losses reported by the Food and Agriculture
  Organization (FAO). Our results reveal that soil moisture is the strongest and
  most reliable predictor of maize yield, driving its spatial and temporal
  variability. Soil moisture was also a more effective indicator of drought
  impacts on crops than precipitation, soil and air temperatures, and remotely
  sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based drought indices.
  This study

  demonstrates how field-scale modeling can help bridge the spatial-scale gap

  between drought monitoring and agricultural impacts.
