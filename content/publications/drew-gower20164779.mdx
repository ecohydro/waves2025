    In dryland environments, characterized by low and frequently variable
    rainfall, smallholder farmers must take crop water sensitivity into account
    along with other characteristics like seed availability and market price
    when deciding what to plant. In this paper we use the results of surveys
    conducted among smallholders located near Mount Kenya to identify clusters
    of farmers devoting different fractions of their land to subsistence and
    market crops. Additionally, we explore the tradeoffs between
    water-insensitive but low-value subsistence crops and a water-sensitive but
    high-value market crop using a numerical model that simulates soil moisture
    dynamics and crop production over multiple growing seasons. The cluster
    analysis shows that most farmers prefer to plant either only subsistence
    crops or only market crops, with a minority choosing to plant substantial
    fractions of both. The model output suggests that the value a farmer places
    on a successful growing season, a measure of risk aversion, plays a large
    role in whether the farmer chooses a subsistence or market crop strategy.
    Furthermore, access to irrigation, makes market crops more appealing, even
    to very risk-averse farmers. We then conclude that the observed clustering
    may result from different levels of risk aversion and access to irrigation.
