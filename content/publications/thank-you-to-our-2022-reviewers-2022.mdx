  (italicized names have contributed 3 or more reviews). We express our deep
  appreciation for your thoughtful comments and suggestions on manuscripts
  submitted to Earth's Future. Your scholarly assessments were fundamental to
  our decisions, and significantly improved the quality of the published papers.
  As a transdisciplinary journal, Earth's Future examines the state of the
  planet and its inhabitants, sustainable, and resilient societies, the science
  of the Anthropocene, and predictions of our common future through research
  articles, reviews, and commentaries. Given the observed and expected global
  environmental and climatic changes, more than ever, we need high quality
  scientific theories, assessments, and projections about the future of our
  planet. To ensure the integrity of research in this area, we rely on your
  expertise and unselfish cooperation. We will need your help in 2023 and
  beyond.
