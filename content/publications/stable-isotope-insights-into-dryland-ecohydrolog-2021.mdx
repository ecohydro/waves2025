  <p>Isotopic tracing of water sources for plants is an increasingly common
  method that supports insight into climatic controls on water availability to
  plants and their use of this available water, especially in water-limited
  environments where isotopic endmembers are distinct. Recent advances in this
  field of research have enabled characterization of annual and seasonal water
  use by plants, whose water sources vary in contribution along a continuum
  between groundwater (isotopically light) to infiltrated precipitation
  (isotopically heavy). Xylem samples are commonly used to characterize
  real-time uptake of water from roots, and they can be contextualized with
  respect to endmember water sources via sampling of root zone water, providing
  these endmembers are isotopically distinct. The time integration of seasonally
  varying water source usage results in the annually recorded isotopic signal
  recorded in tree ring cellulose for temperate trees and shrubs, which reflects
  the dominant water source used in the season of growth. This has enabled
  dendro-isotopic methods that are commonly used to reconstruct past climates
  (isotopically light = colder/wetter; isotopically heavy = warmer/drier).
  However, questions have arisen about the utility of these annually integrated
  dendro-isotopic signatures, given the strong seasonal variations of water use
  that are particularly pronounced in dryland ecosystems, including notable
  water source switching by plants. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>In our
  recent work, we have been pushing isotopic methods in new directions to better
  understand what plants can tell us about how climate affected hydrology across
  dryland regions, and about the associated plant responses. Drylands pose
  interesting research challenges, since water is typically the key limiting
  factor on dryland plant growth, and it is fundamental to the health,
  functioning, composition, distribution, and evolution of vegetation
  communities. In drylands, water availability to plants may vary dramatically
  across space and time, creating challenges for simple analyses of annual water
  use signatures. To aid the understanding of climatically-controlled
  ecohydrology in drylands, we have developed a new tool (ISO-Tool) based on
  established biochemical fractionation theory, which allows for
  back-calculation of water sources used for growth from tree-ring isotopes.
  This tool generates critical knowledge for evaluating dendro-isotopic
  signatures within the same reference frame as sampled endmember water sources,
  and it can be used for both annual and seasonal analyses of plant water use.
  We have also been working on a set of interdisciplinary metrics we call water
  stress indicators (WSIs), which support corroboration of information on
  climatic forcing, water availability, plant water uptake, and ecological
  health of terrestrial vegetation. &#160;&#160;</p><p>Using these new methods,
  we have been able to identify important hydroclimatic gradients in water usage
  for the same species that reflect the local expression of climate into
  plant-available water. We have also begun to understand the whole continuum
  from climate forcing to root-zone water availability to tree growth to canopy
  health. We believe this broader continuum perspective is critical for tackling
  key ecohydrological questions especially in drylands, where we expect large
  variability in water availability across space and time.
