    [1] The isotopic composition of surface fluxes is a key environmental tracer
    currently estimated with a variety of methods, including: Keeling mixing
    models, the flux-gradient technique, and eddy covariance. We present a
    direct inter-comparison of these three methods used to estimate the isotopic
    ratio of water vapor in surface fluxes (dET) over half-hour periods, with a
    focus on the statistical uncertainty of each method (sdET ). We develop
    expressions for sdET as a function of instrument precision, sample size, and
    atmospheric conditions. Uncertainty estimators are validated with high
    frequency (1 Hz) data from multiple configurations of commercial off-axis
    integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) systems. We find measurement
    techniques utilizing the high frequency capabilities of ICOS system
    outperform those methods where a single average of the isotopic composition
    is obtained at each height, with improvements attributed to large sample
    counts and increased variation in observed concentrations. Analytically, and
    with supporting data, we show that over 30 minute periods the Keeling plot
    and flux-gradient techniques produce nearly identical dET and sdET values,
    while eddy covariance calculations always introduce more uncertainty given
    the same high frequency data. This additional uncertainty is proportional to
    the reciprocal of the correlation coefficient between vertical wind speed
    and water vapor mixing ratio. Finally, given the inverse relationship
    between dET uncertainties and the range of water vapor observed, we propose
    that experimental designs should attempt to maximize both sample count and
    the coefficient of variation in atmospheric water vapor. Citation: Good, S.
