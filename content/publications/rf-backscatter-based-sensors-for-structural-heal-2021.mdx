  There is a growing need for accurate and reliable assessment of conditions of
  a variety of engineering structures and for monitoring of their performance.
  Miniaturized, passive, backscatter-based RF sensors with embedded
  computational capabilities could enable advanced structural health monitoring
  at high fidelity and at large-scale. Specifically, these RF-powered devices,
  pervasively embedded and dispersed within the structural material, can sense
  parameters of interest throughout large volumes of instrumented structure,
  perform modest local computations to infer structural conditions, and
  communicate via backscatter modulation while consuming near-zero power. We
  demonstrate that the backscatter channel phase sensing enables quantification
  of a size of air gap between two RF sensors embedded in sand. Additionally, we
  demonstrate the sensitivity of the phase to the strain of the sand.
