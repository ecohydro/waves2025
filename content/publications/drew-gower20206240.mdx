    Smallholder farmers undertake a number of strategies to cope with climate
    shocks in a community. The sharing of resources across households
    constitutes one coping mechanism when environmental shocks differentially
    impact households. This paper investigates commodity sharing dynamics among
    households in eight communities in an environmentally heterogeneous
    highland-lowland area in central Kenya. We use survey data and
    meteorological data to test whether commodity sharing, measured at the
    household level by net inflow of commodities, varies across a regional
    precipitation gradient, and we reveal how sharing fluctuates with rainfall
    over the course of a year. We find both precipitation and income to be
    significant predictors of households’ net value of shared commodities.
    Specifically, farmers who live in drier areas with less income are more
    likely to receive more commodities than they give. We also find that the
    length of time a household has been established in the area is significantly
    related to commodity sharing. Further, commodity sharing follows the pattern
    of harvest and food storage over the course of the year, with households
    giving the most commodities at times when food storage levels are higher,
    that is, post-harvest. The study sheds light on the relationship between
    commodity sharing as a coping mechanism and environmental heterogeneity in a
    region prone to seasonal food insecurity.

**Abstract**:Smallholder farmers undertake a number of strategies to cope with climate shocks in a community. The sharing of resources across households constitutes one coping mechanism when environmental shocks differentially impact households. This paper investigates commodity sharing dynamics among households in eight communities in an environmentally heterogeneous highland-lowland area in central Kenya. We use survey data and meteorological data to test whether commodity sharing, measured at the household level by net inflow of commodities, varies across a regional precipitation gradient, and we reveal how sharing fluctuates with rainfall over the course of a year. We find both precipitation and income to be significant predictors of households’ net value of shared commodities. Specifically, farmers who live in drier areas with less income are more likely to receive more commodities than they give. We also find that the length of time a household has been established in the area is significantly related to commodity sharing. Further, commodity sharing follows the pattern of harvest and food storage over the course of the year, with households giving the most commodities at times when food storage levels are higher, that is, post-harvest. The study sheds light on the relationship between commodity sharing as a coping mechanism and environmental heterogeneity in a region prone to seasonal food insecurity.
