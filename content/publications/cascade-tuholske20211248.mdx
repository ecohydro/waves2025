    Significance Increased extreme heat exposure from both climate change and
    the urban heat island effect threatens rapidly growing urban settlements
    worldwide. Yet, because we do not know where urban population growth and
    extreme heat intersect, we have limited capacity to reduce the impacts of
    urban extreme heat exposure. Here, we leverage fine-resolution temperature
    and population data to measure urban extreme heat exposure for 13,115 cities
    from 1983 to 2016. Globally, urban exposure increased nearly 200%, affecting
    1.7 billion people. Total urban warming elevated exposure rates 52% above
    population growth alone. However, spatially heterogeneous exposure patterns
    highlight an urgent need for locally tailored adaptations and early warning
    systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat exposure across the planet’s
    diverse urban settlements. Increased exposure to extreme heat from both
    climate change and the urban heat island effect—total urban
    warming—threatens the sustainability of rapidly growing urban settlements
    worldwide. Extreme heat exposure is highly unequal and severely impacts the
    urban poor. While previous studies have quantified global exposure to
    extreme heat, the lack of a globally accurate, fine-resolution temporal
    analysis of urban exposure crucially limits our ability to deploy
    adaptations. Here, we estimate daily urban population exposure to extreme
    heat for 13,115 urban settlements from 1983 to 2016. We harmonize global,
    fine-resolution (0.05°), daily temperature maxima and relative humidity
    estimates with geolocated and longitudinal global urban population data. We
    measure the average annual rate of increase in exposure (person-days/year−1)
    at the global, regional, national, and municipality levels, separating the
    contribution to exposure trajectories from urban population growth versus
    total urban warming. Using a daily maximum wet bulb globe temperature
    threshold of 30 °C, global exposure increased nearly 200% from 1983 to 2016.
    Total urban warming elevated the annual increase in exposure by 52% compared
    to urban population growth alone. Exposure trajectories increased for 46% of
    urban settlements, which together in 2016 comprised 23% of the planet’s
    population (1.7 billion people). However, how total urban warming and
    population growth drove exposure trajectories is spatially heterogeneous.
    This study reinforces the importance of employing multiple extreme heat
    exposure metrics to identify local patterns and compare exposure trends
    across geographies. Our results suggest that previous research
    underestimates extreme heat exposure, highlighting the urgency for targeted
    adaptations and early warning systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat
    exposure.

**Abstract**:Increased exposure to extreme heat from both climate change and the urban heat island effect—total urban warming—threatens the sustainability of rapidly growing urban settlements worldwide.
Extreme heat exposure is highly unequal and severely impacts the urban poor. While previous studies have quantified global exposure to extreme heat, the lack of a globally accurate, fine-resolution
temporal analysis of urban exposure crucially limits our ability to deploy adaptations. Here, we estimate daily urban population exposure to extreme heat for 13,115 urban settlements from 1983 to 2016. We
harmonize global, fine-resolution (0.05°), daily temperature maxima and relative humidity estimates with geolocated and longitudinal global urban population data. We measure the average annual rate of
increase in exposure (person-days/year−1) at the global, regional, national, and municipality levels, separating the contribution to exposure trajectories from urban population growth versus total urban
warming. Using a daily maximum wet bulb globe temperature threshold of 30 °C, global exposure increased nearly 200% from 1983 to 2016. Total urban warming elevated the annual increase in exposure by 52%
compared to urban population growth alone. Exposure trajectories increased for 46% of urban settlements, which together in 2016 comprised 23% of the planet’s population (1.7 billion people). However, how
total urban warming and pop- ulation growth drove exposure trajectories is spatially heterogeneous. This study reinforces the importance of employing multiple extreme heat exposure metrics to identify
local patterns and compare exposure trends across geographies. Our results suggest that previous research underestimates extreme heat exposure, highlighting the urgency for targeted adaptations and early
warning systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat exposure.
