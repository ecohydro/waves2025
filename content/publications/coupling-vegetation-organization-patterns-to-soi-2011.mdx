  In dryland ecosystems, understanding the effects of heterogeneity in soil
  moisture and geophysical properties on vegetation structure and dynamics poses
  a suite of challenging research questions. Heterogeneity in soil depth can
  affect resource availability and the subsequent organization of woody
  vegetation, while spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture can reveal
  important ecohydrological feedbacks that govern the outcome of anthropogenic
  activities on the organization of dryland vegetation. In this research we
  investigate two cases of soil resource heterogeneity that affect the
  organization of dryland vegetation patterns by expanding previous
  electromagnetic induction (EMI) imaging techniques. In the first case we
  examine the influence of soil depth as a control on soil resource availability
  on hillslopes in tree‐grass systems in central Kenya. Our results indicate
  that woody vegetation clumping occurs where soil depth changes, and the deeper
  rooted Acacia tortilis occurs on deep soils while the drought tolerant Acacia
  etbaica occurs on shallow soils. In the second case we examine daily
  patch–interpatch scale moisture dynamics following two different‐sized rain
  events in a degraded landscape. With the aid of a numerical subsurface flow
  model, EMI, and soil moisture data, we have identified a possible positive
  feedback mechanism (“soil moisture halo effect”) that we believe may have
  contributed to the proliferation and two‐phase pattern formation of a native
  succulent Sansevieria volkensii in degraded ecosystems of Kenya. By
  determining how different plants respond to, and modify, the soil environment,
  we can better understand resource capture and dynamics, which in the longterm
  will help to develop management strategies.
