    Ecohydrological models provide a tool to investigate the mutual
    relationships between vegetation and the hydrological cycle. Ecohydrological
    modelling studies in developing countries, such as sub-saharan Africa often
    face the problem of extensive parametrical requirements and limited
    available data. Satellite remote sensing data may be able to fill this gap,
    but require novel methodologies to exploit its spatio-temporal information
    that could potentially be incorporated in ecohydrological model calibration
    and validation. The present study aims to implement a distributed
    ecohydrological daily model in a data scarce environment with the support of
    remote sensing data. An automatic calibration procedure, based on Empirical
    Orthogonal Functions techniques, is proposed and applied in the Upper Ewaso
    river basin in Kenya. The model is calibrated only using NDVI (Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index) data derived from MODIS. The obtained results
    demonstrate that: (1) satellite data of vegetation dynamics contains an
    extraordinary amount of information that can be used to implement
    ecohydrological models in scarce data dry regions; (2) the model calibrated
    only using satellite data is able to reproduce both the spatio-temporal
    vegetation dynamics and the observed discharge at the outlet point; and (3)
    the proposed semi-automatic calibration methodology works satisfactorily and
    it allows to incorporate spatio-temporal data in the model parametrization.

**Abstract**:Ecohydrological modeling studies in developing countries, such as sub-Saharan Africa, often face the problem of extensive parametrical requirements and limited available data. Satellite remote sensing data may be able to fill this gap, but require novel methodologies to exploit their spatio-temporal information that could potentially be incorporated into model calibration and validation frameworks. 

The present study tackles this problem by suggesting an automatic calibration procedure, based on the empirical orthogonal function, for distributed ecohydrological daily models. The procedure is tested with the support of remote sensing data in a data-scarce environment – the upper Ewaso Ngiro river basin in Kenya. In the present application, the TETIS-VEG model is calibrated using only NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data derived from MODIS. The results demonstrate that (1) satellite data of vegetation dynamics can be used to calibrate and validate ecohydrological models in water-controlled and data-scarce regions, (2) the model calibrated using only satellite data is able to reproduce both the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics and the observed discharge at the outlet and (3) the proposed automatic calibration methodology works satisfactorily and it allows for a straightforward incorporation of spatio-temporal data into the calibration and validation framework of a model.
