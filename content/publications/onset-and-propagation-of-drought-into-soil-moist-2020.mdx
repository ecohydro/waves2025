  Abstract. Despite clear signals of regional impacts of the recent severe
  drought in California within Central Valley groundwater storage and Sierra
  Nevada forests, our understanding of how this drought affected soil moisture
  and vegetation responses in lowland grasslands is limited. In order to better
  understand the resulting vulnerability of these landscapes to fire and
  ecosystem degradation, we aimed to generalize drought-induced changes in
  subsurface soil moisture and to explore its effects within grassland
  ecosystems of Southern California. We used a decadal in situ dataset of
  high-resolution climate and soil moisture from two grassland sites (coastal
  and inland), alongside greenness (NDVI) data from Landsat to explore drought
  dynamics in environments with similar precipitation but contrasting
  evaporative demand. Analysis of data from 2008 to 2019 showed that the
  negative impacts of prolonged net precipitation (netP) deficits on vegetation
  at the inlands site were buffered by fog and moderate temperatures at the
  coastal site. During the drought, the region experienced an early onset of the
  dry season, resulting in premature senescence of grasses by mid-April. We
  developed a parsimonious soil moisture balance model that captures dynamic
  vegetation–evapotranspiration feedbacks using netP–NDVI relationships as a
  leading indicator. We then analyzed the links between climate, soil moisture,
  and vegetation greenness over decadal timescales, exploring the impacts of
  plausible climate change scenarios that reflect changes to precipitation
  amounts, their seasonal distribution, and evaporative demand. We found that
  all scenarios generate early, extreme soil moisture deficits during drought
  below a vegetation stress threshold, further intensifying early dry season
  onset and vegetation die-off. These changes suggest potential increases in the
  risk of wildfires in this and similar regions under climate change, as well as
  increased grassland ecosystem vulnerability.
