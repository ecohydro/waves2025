  Effects of agricultural practices on ecosystem carbon storage have acquired
  widespread concern due to its alleviation of rising atmospheric CO2
  concentrations. Recently, combining of furrow-ridge with plastic film mulching
  in spring maize ecosystem was widely applied to boost crop water productivity
  in the semiarid regions of China. However, there is still limited information
  about the potentials for increased ecosystem carbon storage of this tillage
  method. The objective of this study was to quantify and contrast net carbon
  dioxide exchange, biomass accumulation and carbon budgets of maize (Zea maize
  L.) fields under the traditional non-mulching with flat tillage (CK) and
  partial plastic film mulching with furrow-ridge tillage (MFR) on the China
  Loess Plateau. Half-hourly net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of both treatments
  were synchronously measured with two eddy covariance systems during the
  growing seasons of 2011 through 2013. At same time green leaf area index
  (GLAI) and biomass were also measured biweekly. Compared with CK, the warmer
  and wetter (+1.3°C and +4.3%) top soil at MFR accelerated the rates of biomass
  accumulation, promoted greater green leaf area and thus shortened the growing
  seasons by an average value of 10.4 days for three years. MFR stimulated
  assimilation more than respiration during whole growing season, resulting in a
  higher carbon sequestration in terms of NEE of -79 gC/m2 than CK. However,
  after considering carbon in harvested grain (or aboveground biomass), there is
  a slight higher carbon sink (or a stronger carbon source) in MFR due to its
  greater difference of aboveground biomass than that of grain between both
  treatments. These results demonstrate that partial plastic film mulched
  furrow-ridge tillage with aboveground biomass exclusive of grain returned to
  the soil is an effective way to enhance simultaneously carbon sequestration
  and grain yield of maize in the semiarid regions.
