 Heatwave events significantly alter ecosystem water and energy balance and are often accompanied by extreme surface temperatures. Understanding how surface temperatures during such events are regulated by soil evaporation (
 E
 ) and vegetation transpiration (
 T
 ) remains limited due to challenges in partitioning total evapotranspiration (
 ET
 ). Here, high‐frequency turbulence methods are used to partition observed
 ET
 at 32 National Ecological Observatory Network sites across the contiguous United States. Heatwaves were defined as at least three consecutive days with daily maximum air temperature exceeding the site‐specific 90th percentile of the 2019–2021 record. Across 268 identified events, the
 T/ET
 ratio decreased by 32% ± 16% relative to the non‐heatwave baseline of 0.65, with greater reductions at lower biomass sites. The
 T/ET
 ratio was typically suppressed below non‐heatwave conditions during the early and middle stages of the heatwave (first two‐thirds of event duration), but was on average higher than non‐heatwave baseline levels during late stages (final third) due to extremely low soil evaporation. Of the studied heatwaves, 71% of these had surface temperatures above 38°C in their late stage; however, heatwaves sustaining higher evaporation fluxes (upper tertile of observed fluxes) during the late stage were associated with relative surface temperature anomalies that were on average 45% lower than those of heatwaves with lower evaporation fluxes (lower tertile). The commensurate surface cooling induced by higher transpiration was only 2% during heatwaves, suggesting that transpiration has a limited ability to mitigate extreme surface temperatures. This study allows for improved prediction of ecosystem feedbacks under extreme thermal stress.
