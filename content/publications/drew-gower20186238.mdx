    Farmers are carving a new agricultural frontier from the forests in the
    Southeast Asian Massif (SAM) in the 21st century, triggering significant
    environment degradation at the local scale; however, this frontier has been
    missed by existing global land use and forest loss analyses. In this paper,
    we chose Thailand's Nan Province, which is located in the geometric center
    of SAM, as a case study, and combined high resolution forest cover change
    product with a fine‐scale land cover map to investigate land use dynamics
    with respect to topography in this region. Our results show that total
    forest loss in Nan Province during 2001–2016 was 66,072 ha (9.1% of the
    forest cover in 2000), and that the majority of this lost forest (92%) had
    been converted into crop (mainly corn) fields by 2017. Annual forest loss is
    significantly correlated with global corn price (p < 0.01), re‐confirming
    agricultural expansion as a key driver of forest loss in Nan Province. Along
    with the increasing global corn price, forest loss in Nan Province has
    accelerated at a rate of 2,616 ± 730 ha per decade (p < 0.01). Global corn
    price peaked in 2012, in which year annual forest loss also reached its peak
    (7,523 ha); since then, the location of forest loss has moved to steeper
    land at higher elevations. Spatially, forest loss driven by this smallholder
    agricultural expansion emerges as many small patches that are not
    recognizable even at a moderate spatial resolution (e.g. 300 m). It explains
    how existing global land use/cover change products have missed the
    widespread and rapid forest loss in SAM. It also highlights the importance
    of high‐resolution observations to evaluate the environmental impacts of
    agricultural expansion and forest loss in SAM, including, but not limited
    to, the impacts on the global carbon cycle, regional hydrology, and local
    environmental degradation.

**Abstract**:Farmers are carving a new agricultural frontier from the forests in the Southeast Asian Massif (SAM) in the 21st century, triggering significant environment degradation at the local scale; however, this frontier has been missed by existing global land use and forest loss analyses. In this paper, we chose Thailand's Nan Province, which is located in the geometric center of SAM, as a case study, and combined high resolution forest cover change product with a fine‐scale land cover map to investigate land use dynamics with respect to topography in this region. Our results show that total forest loss in Nan Province during 2001–2016 was 66,072 ha (9.1% of the forest cover in 2000), and that the majority of this lost forest (92%) had been converted into crop (mainly corn) fields by 2017. Annual forest loss is significantly correlated with global corn price (p < 0.01), re‐confirming agricultural expansion as a key driver of forest loss in Nan Province. Along with the increasing global corn price, forest loss in Nan Province has accelerated at a rate of 2,616 ± 730 ha per decade (p < 0.01). Global corn price peaked in 2012, in which year annual forest loss also reached its peak (7,523 ha); since then, the location of forest loss has moved to steeper land at higher elevations. Spatially, forest loss driven by this smallholder agricultural expansion emerges as many small patches that are not recognizable even at a moderate spatial resolution (e.g. 300 m). It explains how existing global land use/cover change products have missed the widespread and rapid forest loss in SAM. It also highlights the importance of high‐resolution observations to evaluate the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion and forest loss in SAM, including, but not limited to, the impacts on the global carbon cycle, regional hydrology, and local environmental degradation.
