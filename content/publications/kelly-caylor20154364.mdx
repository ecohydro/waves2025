    © 2015 McCauley et al. The common hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius,
    transports millions of tons of organic matter annually from its terrestrial
    feeding grounds into aquatic habitats. We evaluated whether carbon stable
    isotopes (δ13C) can be used as tracers for determining whether H.
    amphibius-vectored allochthonous material is utilized by aquatic consumers.
    Two approaches were employed to make this determination: (1) lab-based
    feeding trials where omnivorous river fish were fed a H. amphibius dung diet
    and (2) field sampling of fish and aquatic insects in pools with and without
    H. amphibius. Lab trials revealed that fish fed exclusively H. amphibius
    dung exhibited significantly more positive δ13C values than fish not fed
    dung. Fish and aquatic insects sampled in a river pool used for decades by
    H. amphibius also exhibited more positive δ13C values at the end of the dry
    season than fish and insects sampled from an upstream H. amphibius-free
    reference pool. Fish sampled in these same pools at the end of the wet
    season (high flow) showed no significant differences in δ13C values,
    suggesting that higher flows reduced retention and use of H. amphibius
    subsidies. These data provide preliminary evidence that δ13C values may be
    useful, in certain contexts, for quantifying the importance H. amphibius
    organic matter.
