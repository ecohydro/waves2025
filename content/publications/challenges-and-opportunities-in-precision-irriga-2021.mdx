abstract: >-
  Irrigation is critical to sustain agricultural productivity in dry or semi-dry
  environments, and center pivots, due to their versatility and ruggedness, are
  the most widely used irrigation systems. To effectively use center pivot
  irrigation systems, producers require tools to support their decision-making
  on when and how much water to irrigate. However, currently producers make
  these decisions primarily based on experience and/or limited information of
  weather. Ineffective use of irrigation systems can lead to overuse of water
  resources, compromise crop productivity, and directly reduce producers’
  economic return as well as bring negative impacts on environmental
  sustainability. In this paper, we surveyed existing precision irrigation
  research and tools from peer-reviewed literature, land-grant university
  extension and industry products, and U.S. patents. We focused on four
  challenge areas related to precision irrigation decision-support systems: (a)
  data availability and scalability, (b) quantification of plant water stress,
  (c) model uncertainties and constraints, and (d) producers’ participation and
  motivation. We then identified opportunities to address the above four
  challenge areas: (a) increase the use of high spatial-temporal-resolution
  satellite fusion products and inexpensive sensor networks to scale up the
  adoption of precision irrigation decision-support systems; (b) use mechanistic
  quantification of ‘plant water stress’ as triggers to improve irrigation
  decision, by explicitly considering the interaction between soil water supply,
  atmospheric water demand, and plant physiological regulation; (c) constrain
  the process-based and statistical/machine learning models at each individual
  field using data-model fusion methods for scalable solutions; and (d) develop
  easy-to-use tools with flexibility, and increase governments’ financial
  incentives and support. We conclude this review by laying out our vision for
  precision irrigation decision-support systems for center pivots that can
  achieve scalable, economical, reliable, and easy-to-use irrigation management
  for producers.
