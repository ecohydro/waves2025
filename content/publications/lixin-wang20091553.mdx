    The (18)O and (2)H of water vapor serve as powerful tracers of hydrological
    processes. The typical method for determining water vapor delta(18)O and
    delta(2)H involves cryogenic trapping and isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
    Even with recent technical advances, these methods cannot resolve vapor
    composition at high temporal resolutions. In recent years, a few groups have
    developed continuous laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) approaches for
    measuring delta(18)O and delta(2)H which achieve accuracy levels similar to
    those of lab-based mass spectrometry methods. Unfortunately, most LAS
    systems need cryogenic cooling and constant calibration to a reference gas,
    and have substantial power requirements, making them unsuitable for
    long-term field deployment at remote field sites. A new method called
    Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) has been developed
    which requires extremely low-energy consumption and neither reference gas
    nor cryogenic cooling. In this report, we develop a relatively simple
    pumping system coupled to a dew point generator to calibrate an ICOS-based
    instrument (Los Gatos Research Water Vapor Isotope Analyzer (WVIA) DLT-100)
    under various pressures using liquid water with known isotopic signatures.
    Results show that the WVIA can be successfully calibrated using this
    customized system for different pressure settings, which ensure that this
    instrument can be combined with other gas-sampling systems. The precisions
    of this instrument and the associated calibration method can reach
    approximately 0.08 per thousand for delta(18)O and approximately 0.4 per
    thousand for delta(2)H. Compared with conventional mass spectrometry and
    other LAS-based methods, the OA-ICOS technique provides a promising
    alternative tool for continuous water vapor isotopic measurements in field
    deployments.

The 18O and 2H of water vapor serve as powerful tracers of hydrological processes. The typical method for determining water vapor 18O and 2H involves cryogenic trapping and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Even with recent technical advances, these methods cannot resolve vapor composition at high temporal resolutions. In recent years, a few groups have developed continuous laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) approaches for measuring 18O and 2H which achieve accuracy levels similar to those of lab-based mass spectrometry methods. Unfortunately, most LAS systems need cryogenic cooling and constant calibration to a reference gas, and have substantial power requirements, making them unsuitable for long-term field deployment at remote field sites. A new method called Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) has been developed which requires extremely low-energy consumption and neither reference gas nor cryogenic cooling. In this report, we develop a relatively simple pumping system coupled to a dew point generator to calibrate an ICOS-based instrument (Los Gatos Research Water Vapor Isotope Analyzer (WVIA) DLT-100) under various pressures using liquid water with known isotopic signatures. Results show that the WVIA can be successfully calibrated using this customized system for different pressure settings, which ensure that this instrument can be combined with other gas-sampling systems. The precisions of this instrument and the associated calibration method can reach 0.08 for 18O and 0.4 for 2H. Compared with conventional mass spectrometry and other LAS-based methods, the OA-ICOS technique provides a promising alternative tool for continuous water vapor isotopic measurements in field deployments.
