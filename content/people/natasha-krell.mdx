Natasha joined the Caylor Lab in Summer 2015 as an intern at the [Mpala Research Center](http://mpala.org) in Kenya where she studied vegetation pattern and fracture formation in soils. Natasha graduated from [College of the Atlantic](http://coa.edu) in 2016. 

Natasha's research explored the intersection between information technologies, climate variability, and food security in smallholder systems. She was awarded a Fulbright Research Fellowship to Kenya in 2018, was appointed as a Schmidt Environmental Fellow, and her dissertation was supported by Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship.
