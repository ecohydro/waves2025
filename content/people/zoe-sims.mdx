Zoe is a PhD candidate in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB, where she applies the tools of ecology to agricultural systems in pursuit of improved crop yields and farmer well-being.

Her interdisciplinary PhD research examines the impacts of crop biodiversity on production, nutrient cycling, and outcomes for farmers, using meta-analysis, field experiments, spatial modeling, and farmer interviews. Zoe's work specifically focuses on intercropping—growing more than one crop within a field during the same season—and its effects on crop yields, nitrogen use efficiency, and farmer decision-making.

Before joining WAVES, Zoe developed her passion for ecology and policy through diverse experiences: she served as lead staff for the Chair of the Water and Land Committee at the Hawai'i House of Representatives, and spent a year as a Princeton-in-Africa Fellow conducting outreach and education at Mpala Research Centre in Laikipia, Kenya. Originally from the Big Island of Hawai'i, Zoe graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University, where her senior thesis quantified the impacts of anthropogenic nutrient pollution on near-shore coral reefs in Bermuda.

Outside of science, Zoe loves trail running, ocean swimming, cultivating her vegetable garden, and experimenting with new ways to cook beans.
