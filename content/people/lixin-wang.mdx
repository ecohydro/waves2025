Lixin's research interests include spatial and temporal patterns of water and nitrogen availability, how vegetation adapts to and affects such patterns, and how future climate/land use changes affect vegetation-resources interactions. He uses a variety of research tools, including analyses based on stable isotopes, manipulative experiments, field observations, geostatistical methods, greenhouse experiments and process-based modeling to tackle these questions.
