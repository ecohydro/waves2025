Kaiyu’s research focused on the interactions between hydrological cycles and vegetation dynamics in Africa, with specific interests on tropical ecosystems, including tropical savanna and tropical forests. He uses land surface models ([VIC](http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/) and [SEIB](http://seib-dgvm.com/)) and environmental sensing technology (satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle-based sensing systems and field spectometer) to address those science questions.

He defended his PhD thesis in September 2013. After a postdoc with [Prof. David Lobell](http://foodsecurity.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell) at Stanford University, he is now an <a href="http://nres.illinois.edu/directory/kaiyug" target="_blank">assistant professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>.
