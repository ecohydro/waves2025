Lyndon’s primary interest lies in understanding how global change (climate change and food demand) shapes agricultural land uses, and how these in turn impact terrestrial ecosystems and species. He uses remote sensing and spatially-explicit simulation models as his primary tools of investigation. Further details on his research are <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~lestes" target="_blank">here</a>.
