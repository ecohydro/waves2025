Despite coming from the tropics, Diana’s main interests are African drylands. She has been researching the Kalahari in Botswana for almost 10 years since the time of her MSc fieldwork and she still thinks there’s much more to learn there. In order to continue her investigations on the ways trees use water, after finishing her PhD in the Netherlands she moved to Princeton where she found common interests with our group. Diana is currently studying the role that roots play in the seasonal patterns of water redistribution. This work is taking advantage of the new insights we have gained on Kalahari below-ground coarse root biomass patterns during the past three years.

Diana is now doing independent consulting in water management in the Netherlands.
