Drew comes to the Caylor Lab after having previously worked as as Peace Corps volunteer in Burkina Faso and a Middle East program specialist for the US Forest Service Office of International Programs. His PhD focused on how food security in developing countries is affected by hydrologic variability, particularly in the dryland regions of Africa.
