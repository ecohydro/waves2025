![Mt. Kenya](){: .align-left} Trenton Franz and Kelly Caylor are spending 2 weeks field campaign to central Kenyan highlands.

<!--more-->The trip is a sort of "fact-finding" expedition, since neither Kelly or Trenton have been to Kenya before. We will be hosted by the Mpala Research Center, which is located near Nanyuki on the Laikipia plateau just beyond the northern slopes of Mt. Kenya. Some images from the trip are located here.
