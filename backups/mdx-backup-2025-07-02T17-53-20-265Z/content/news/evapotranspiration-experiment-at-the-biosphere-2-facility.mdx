![Biosphere II](){: .align-right} During Sep 18-Oct 29, 2008, Lixin Wang stayed at Biosphere 2 (University of Arizona) to collaborate with Juan Villegas, Travis Huxman and David Breshears in their project to see how vegetation cover determines relative contribution of transpiration and evapotranspiration to total evapotranspiration. Lixin applied the new continuous isotope measurement technique he developed at the MMSF field site to provide an alternative way to partition evaporation and transpiration using the distinctly different isotopic fractionation that occurs during each process.
