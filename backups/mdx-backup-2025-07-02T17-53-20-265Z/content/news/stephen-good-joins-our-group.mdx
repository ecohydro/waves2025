![Stephen Good](){: .align-right} The newest member of our group is Stephen Good, who is beginning work on a Ph.D. Stephen comes to us from Michigan Tech, where he earned a Masters degree in Environmental Engineering while also working as Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic. During his time in the Peace Corps, Stephen worked with a group of small communities to plan, finance, design, construct, and maintain rural water systems. He helped to install 13 km of hand dug trenches, built a 50,000 gallon storage tank, and connected about 200 families to a community water system. We’ve included a few photos of his work in the Dominican Republic, and are excited to have Stephen here at Princeton.
