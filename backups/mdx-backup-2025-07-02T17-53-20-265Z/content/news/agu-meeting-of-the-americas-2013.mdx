[Frances]() and [Cynthia]() attended the AGU Meeting of the Americas, held in Cancun, Mexico from May 14th to May 17th 2013.

Frances presided a successful session on "Emerging Methods for Measuring the Structure and Spatial Distribution of Plants Roots". The invited speakers were:
  
&#8211; [Naama Raz-Yaseef](http://esd.lbl.gov/about/staff/naamarazyaseef/), "Coarse root distribution of a semi-arid oak savanna estimated with ground penetrating radar",
  
&#8211; [Jeffrey Warren](http://www.esd.ornl.gov/ecosystem_science/people/j_warren.shtml), "Roots revealed &#8211; Neutron imaging insight of spatial distribution, morphology  growth and function",
  
&#8211; [Michael Allen](http://www.facultydirectory.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/pub/public_individual.pl?faculty=385), " Comparative daily dynamics of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae across differing ecosystems using an automated minirhizotron and sensor network".
  
Frances closed the session with a presentation of her work on "Species-level diversity of belowground structure in savanna woody plants".

Cynthia presented a poster on how ground penetrating radar measurements show a spatial relationship between coarse root biomass and soil carbon abundance.
